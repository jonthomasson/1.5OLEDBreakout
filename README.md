1.5" OLED Breakout SSD1351

Who doesn't love OLED's? They're low power requirements as well as vibrant color displays are alluring to the hacker. While working on a few projects recently I had the need to interface with one of these OLED displays. There didn't seem to be any breakout boards that broke out the parallel interface pins of the controller, so I decided to make my own.
